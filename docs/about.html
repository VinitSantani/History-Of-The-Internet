          <p>The purpose of this assignment was to teach us how to create, develop, and collaborate with a teammate to create a fully functioning website.</p>
          <p>This website is our first attempt at using html and bootstrap. Neither of us have any previous coding experience so naturally web development with html and bootstrap was a scary task, but after watching Professor Williams's demo videos and doing some additional research we were able to successfully complete the task at hand!</p>
          <p>We got a chance to solidify our git collaboration skills from the previous project and are now more comfortable using pycharm and utilizing some of is unique features for web development. Taking the time to learn about html and bootstrapping will pay dividends in the future as the internet becomes more and more prevalent. It is impossible to escape using such a core language as html and bootstrapping enhances the webpages that we develop.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>In addition to learning how to use these languages, we also learned about the history of the internet. This gave us the crucial background that helped put into context how we got to where we are today. From the inception of the internet to the the development of browsers and search engines, we were able to get a better understanding of why some coding and IT principles are the way that they are. This will also give us an addition benefit when we are communicating with anyone in the CS field, as we would have a better grasp of how the underlying technology works.</p>
          <p>In all, this project was a great opportunity to get hands on experience with web development. It has taught us lessons about how we can work together more efficiently in a team and more importantly it has given us the confidence to build webpages easily. Previously, we had this stigma around coding in html, but once we realized that there are templates that we can utilize for everything and that we dont need to memorize every bit of code, we were able to move much quicker by picking and choosing specific parts of a webpage that we like and incorporating that into our own.</p>

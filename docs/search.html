        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moving on from the browser era, the next big thing was search. The internet browser was the perfect vehicle that could make finding information online easy, but the problem was that there was no existing &ldquo;search engine&rdquo; at the time. This was solved in the early 200s by Silicon Valley natives Jerry Yang and David Filo. Trying to win a Stanford fantasy basketball league, they stumbled upon the idea which would then lead them to create a guide to the internet. This directory that they created, immediately grew in popularity- Yahoo was then born.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Search was incredibly popular at this time, but still no one had figured out how to monetize this feature. Advertising was the clear path for revenue, but this was a highly risky proposition at the time as there was a stigma around selling space on their page for ads. Nonetheless, yahoo went ahead and agreed to display ads, and their user count kept growing. This was the first time that monetization had successfully been pulled off on the web.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yahoo was not the only player at this time however. Excite was another startup with one fundamental difference. Rather than manually entering and creating this directory of sites, excite used software to crawl the internet and search for results. These platforms started to fiercely compete and used a tit for tat strategy. As soon as one company came out with a unique feature, the other would immediately follow and develop their version of that feature and launch it as well.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This led to another problem; these companies which started out as essentially search engines evolved to something much more. But in the journey they forgot about their original intent which was the search feature itself. This is where google came into play. They were able to deduce the fact that the most clicked on results were the closest to the search that they were looking for. Link counting became the core of Google&rsquo;s success. Most importantly, google brought back the idea and popularity of search again.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After multiple large investments, google had pressure to find a good business model. Up till now they had revolutionized the search engine and undeniably created a unique product, but they had not yet figured out a way to monetize this. They did not want to simply splatter their sites with ads that did not make sense like Yahoo and Excite. This is when Google turned to a model from a smaller company called overture where they would cater ads to a specific person based on keywords. It used these keywords as data points- essentially acting as a market research tool. Google was able to take this concept and incorporate it into their search engine and it was an immediate success.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before taking their company public in 2004 there was a lot of skepticism because this was the period right after the Dot com bubble. However, this logic proved to be wrong. Immediately after their shares started trading they shot up and never looked back. Since then google has poured its enormous resources into various projects. As google expanded more and more they came head to head with more competitors.&nbsp;</span></p>

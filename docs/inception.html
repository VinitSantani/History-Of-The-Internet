        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the rise of computers, the internet changed the way that we as humans communicate.The internet connected people from different areas in different timezones effectively and removed barriers for communication. One of the key principles of the internet is that it is a decentralized system. Spurred by Russia&rsquo;s successful launch of Sputnik into orbit in the last 1950s, the US started to invest heavily into computer science through space exploration projects such as ARPA.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The roots of the internet start with data transmission- how is data sent from one point to another. This is done by breaking up the info into smaller more digestible pieces of data called &ldquo;packets.&rdquo; A packet switching network was the solution for transporting this data to various locations. The theory was that multiple computers would be connected to a network and they would act as nodes. A packet of data would then be sent from one node to another until it arrived at its destination.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While many big telecom companies back in the day were very skeptical of the new networking technology that larry roberts sought to bring to life, he was able to figure out a way to make this work. Some of the issues that Roberts and his team faced were that:</span></p>
        <ul>
        <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was no commonality among all computers</span></li>
        <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There wasn&rsquo;t a way to tell if the data was going to arrive at its destination or just keep bouncing off and being sent to different nodes</span></li>
        <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There wasn&rsquo;t a way to tell where or how the computer was failing</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once these issues were resolved and the ARPA net was up and running there were 18 different computers spread out across the US that were now able to communicate. However, the next hurdle was that there were very few use cases that would make these connections useful or accessible. In 1972 however, that changed when Ray Tomlinson created the first email program. This pioneered the way for new communication methods and opened peoples minds.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The internet was a very open sourced project meaning that anyone that had access and the knowledge of networks was able to start developing useful applications and was also able to share them. Initially this was limited to academia since they were very interested in sharing knowledge with each other. Since more people were working on different and unique ideas, they were able to help each other out in solving issues that arose. After the International Conference on Computers and communications, the development of computers took off. More networks started to emerge. LANs or Local area Networks started emerging as a way to communicate within an office, and WANs, Wide Area Networks,&nbsp; started to emerge as a way to connect different campuses.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This however presented a new problem, all of these networks communicated on their own, but were not interconnected. For this problem Bob Khan developed the TCP/IP Protocol and was able to connect various local networks through a gateway. This essentially created a single language for these various networks to communicate with each other and was eventually adopted as the international standard.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The internet was still not commercially viable for personal use, however this changed when the government passed a law which allowed free enterprise for the internet which sparked development and innovation. This marked the beginning of a new era which made computers more accessible to the average person and allowed for the development of new applications which would spark the growth of the internet.&nbsp;</span></p>

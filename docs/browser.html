        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the rise in popularity of personal computers, their functionality also rose. There were new applications which enhanced the user experience and provided a whole new level of value. At the time Microsoft was the king in the personal computing space and Bill Gates wanted to ensure that it remained that way. Gates was skeptical about the web, and he still wanted to ensure that Microsoft had full control of it. There was however a rising company that had its sights on Microsoft; Netscape.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Netscape was founded by a team of college kids that created a graphical user interface that could display images and videos as well. Jim Clarke, a Stanford professor and silicon valley legend,&nbsp; then came along and provided them with the funds to work on this concept. Eventually they got their new browser dubbed &ldquo;Navigator.&rdquo; This was an instant success and most people couldn&rsquo;t even comprehend how quickly they rose to power. Microsoft was worried and shocked at this. Up till now they had been the primary platform which developers would build out apps for and there was virtually no competition. This changed with Netscape because they were able to show people that there is an alternate option as well. People no longer had the full confidence that Microsoft was indeed the unquestionable future platform and this started a war that would rage on for years.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microsoft met with Netscape and tried to cut a deal with them, but with no success. Instead, this spurred the competition between the 2 companies and gave Netscape more passion to beat out their competitors. Soon after, Netscape was taken public vio an IPO and shares skyrocketed. Netscape ignited the internet boom, and was looking at some very handsome profits. Netscape&rsquo;s rise gave them the confidence to start jabbing at Microsoft and downplaying it. Microsoft was still a giant and leading in the computer space, but Netscape&rsquo;s quick rise got to their heads and motivated Microsoft to go all in against Netscape.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microsoft then quickly responded with their own browser; Internet Explorer. Bill Gates went all in with Microsoft in trying to capture as much market share from Netscape as possible. They would imitate all the features that netscape had as soon as possible. Internet explorer was catching up to Netscape, but the issue was that Microsoft was a giant compared to Netscape. They had much more capital and were able to offer Internet Explorer for free on Windows as opposed to webscape which had to charge a fee to its users. This was the final nail in the coffin for Netscape which let Microsoft emerge triumphant.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 1998, the US Government launched an antitrust investigation into Microsoft. Gates was grilled on his antitrust practices against Netscape and other competitors and was eventually Microsoft was found guilty. They were initially ordered to split the company, which led to a drastic stock sell off, but eventually in an appeals court they ruled it too harsh and allowed Microsoft to remain whole. After this initial saga, Gates retired from his position and handed off the reins to his successor Steve Ballmer.&nbsp;</span></p>

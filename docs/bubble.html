      <div class="container-md mt-4">
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Dot Com Bubble set off with the emergence of Amazon and eBay in the second half of the 1990s. Amazon, with being noticed at Wall Street, worked towards customer satisfaction. On the other hand, eBay had to hire a business analyst to understand the stocks only to come up with the per share price going up to $50 a share from $18 a share.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon started off with selling books and the strategy of Get Big Fast. This meant that Jeff Bezos was working on bringing in more traffic to his website rather than focusing on profits. After hiring a BA and the per share price, eBay undoubtedly did not go unnoticed on Wall Street.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the Dot Com Bubble had gained some momentum, every developer out there started migrating to the Silicon Valley.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was not much later that Intel set foot in the Bubble with the high speed fibre optic cables to provide a worldwide connection across trillions of computers and provide a helping hand to considerably increase bandwidth.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A tech-trio in Europe came up with the ideology of public key cryptography to ensure safe online payment transactions and more scope in the technology market.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Programmers of any age group started creating online commerce platforms. The Bubble was growing in size. This brought a recession for the traditional analysts and they started losing their jobs.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nasdaq and day traders were minting profits as were all the hungry investors and venture capitalists by investing huge sums of money to gain a position in the new business.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As they say, everything that comes up also has to go down. The Dot Com Bubble had started popping. Amazon&rsquo;s book publishers, for instance, were getting immense hatred because random people were posting negative reviews on the website. Jeff Bezos came up saying, &ldquo;Selling books is your business, customer satisfaction - is mine.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nasdaq crashed down by 335 points with creating humongous monetary losses and a day termed to be The Black Friday. Later came the 9/11 which almost burst the Bubble, crashed the stock market, recession was at its peak, all the e-commerce platforms without a plan hit the rock bottom with full speed.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wonder how Amazon and eBay survived? Well, they had a plan and perfect crisis management skills. Later in the 2000s, YouTube and Facebook walked on the same footsteps and created a standing in the market. Hence, the Dot Com Bubble turned out to be a boon in creating a new economy globally.</span></p>

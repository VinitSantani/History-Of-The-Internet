        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right before the People Powered Web, there were big shots who decided where and when you can access the information and also how much you should pay for it.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The World Wide Web was expanding after the Bubble. It was taking a new curve for the entertainment and advertisement industry. </span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was time to see how the world is changing the web.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were sites like Digg which focused on news and the most voted piece made it on the front page of the website.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was followed by MySpace which gave a feel of your own personal room and looked like a potential market to increase business by posting advertisements.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soon after came Facebook and YouTube whose motto were to share relationship emotions through a social graph in the backend and &lsquo;broadcast yourself&rsquo;, respectively.&nbsp; Wisdom of the crowd was the new silicon valley jargon.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook was started by the 23 year old Mark Zuckerberg and it kept on expanding and piercing its way in whichever industry it possibly could. It was termed another Google.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amidst this new mist, the music industry alone had started facing a cheeky way regarding what the society thought it to be in 2001. The tedious and traditional way of acquiring your new favourite soundtrack just had a life hack- Napster by Shawn Fanning.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyone with the software could search for the music and talk to people about how it was. This had copyright issues and gloomy faces of established bands like Metallica and Dr. Dre.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Napster had a million users in 4 months. This is how fast it was growing.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hillary Rosen and the RIAA filed a lawsuit against Napster and it finally had to shut down in 2001 because sharing mp3 tracks like this was illegal.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, this created a boom in the idea and Apple came up with iMusic where any track could be bought for 99 cents.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">YouTube had repercussions too, but it was smart enough to pave its way out of it.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This era was proudly termed as Web 2.0 with powerful individuals coming into picture. The Web 2.0 saw the uprising of Craigslist, Wikipedia and Blogs.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The real meaning of the web had been lost and now restored when Sir Tim Berners Lee said that the original idea was to be a two way thing.</span></p>
